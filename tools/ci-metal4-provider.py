"""Pins the Metal 4 execution provider's skeleton: what it owns, what it refuses, and how it is reached.

Phase 2 asks for a generation-specific provider and only a skeleton of one. Two things about that are easy to
undo by accident and expensive to notice:

  - the provider must stay reachable through the NEUTRAL interface, so the services can hand it out for the
    executing generation without learning a Metal 4 type. A provider that grew a Metal 4 command type in a
    signature would put a generation into the shared seam;
  - its unimplemented halves must fail by name. A provider that returned null would move the failure into
    whatever first used the state, twenty calls later, which section 35 of the migration plan forbids and
    which is exactly the distortion the capability probe was rebuilt to remove.
